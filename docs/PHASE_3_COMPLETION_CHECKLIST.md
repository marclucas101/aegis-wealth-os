# Phase 3 Completion Checklist — Supabase Backend

**Completed:** 2026-06-10  
**Final phase:** 3O — Final Supabase Reliability Review and Hardening

---

## Phase Summary (3B → 3O)

| Phase | Description | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| **3B** | Supabase migrations (schema, enums, RLS, storage) | ✅ |
| **3C** | Supabase client setup (`client.ts`, `server.ts`, `admin.ts`, middleware session) | ✅ |
| **3D** | Supabase health check (`/supabase-health`, `/api/health/supabase`) | ✅ |
| **3E** | Supabase Auth (login, signup, callback, protected routes) | ✅ |
| **3F** | User/client provisioning (`ensureUserClientProfile`, one client per user) | ✅ |

**Phase 4F.1 extension:** On first authenticated session, `ensureUserClientProfile()` links an existing placeholder `clients` row (matching email, `user_id` null, status `onboarding`/`prospect`) instead of inserting a duplicate. If multiple placeholders match, the most recently created row is used. Emits `client_placeholder_linked_to_user` audit event.
| **3G** | Discover™ saves to Supabase (`/api/discover/save`, scoring chain) | ✅ |
| **3H** | Dashboard loads from Supabase (`/api/dashboard/current`) | ✅ |
| **3I** | Modules load from Supabase (shield, roadmap, stress, blueprint, annual review) | ✅ |
| **3J** | Roadmap status persists (`/api/roadmap/status`) | ✅ |
| **3K** | Wealth Blueprint & Annual Review snapshots save | ✅ |
| **3L** | Document Vault uploads (upload, list, signed-url, delete) | ✅ |
| **3M** | Interactive Stress Test persistence (run + history) | ✅ |
| **3N** | Audit logging & API hardening (`apiGuards`, `auditLog`, client_id rejection) | ✅ |
| **3O** | Final reliability & security review (this checklist + `SUPABASE_SECURITY_REVIEW.md`) | ✅ |

## Database Tables Activated

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `users` | App profile extending `auth.users` |
| `clients` | Wealth subject (one per MVP user) |
| `client_profiles` | Derived Discover summary |
| `discover_profiles` | Versioned onboarding data |
| `financial_profiles` | Scoring input snapshots |
| `shield_scores` | Shield score snapshots |
| `pillar_scores` | Per-pillar breakdown |
| `stress_tests` | Stress scenario results |
| `roadmap_items` | Generated actions + user status |
| `annual_reviews` | Yearly review snapshots |
| `wealth_blueprints` | Blueprint report snapshots |
| `documents` | Document vault metadata |
| `advisor_notes` | Schema ready (unused until Advisor OS) |
| `audit_logs` | Write audit trail |

**Storage:** `client-documents` bucket with RLS policies (migration `202606100010_storage_policies.sql`).

## Storage Features Working

- [x] Upload with size (10 MB), type, and category validation
- [x] List documents (optional category filter)
- [x] Signed URL generation (120s expiry, ownership check)
- [x] Soft-delete (archive + storage removal)
- [x] Client-scoped storage paths (`clients/{clientId}/documents/…`)

---

## Security Controls Verified (3O)

- [x] No API route accepts browser `client_id` / `clientId` for writes
- [x] All protected write routes require auth
- [x] Service role key server-only (`import "server-only"` on admin modules)
- [x] No admin client in Client Components
- [x] Route errors sanitized (`toPublicErrorMessage` on all API routes)
- [x] Audit logging on all major writes; failures non-blocking
- [x] Document upload/delete/signed-url ownership checks
- [x] Roadmap status scoped to session client + active item
- [x] Stress test run validates scenario/severity enums
- [x] Report saves use server-loaded snapshots only
- [x] Middleware protects app pages; public routes remain public
- [x] Phase 4Q: in-memory rate limits on write-heavy and command-center routes
- [x] Phase 4Q: `rejectUnexpectedFields` on privileged write bodies/form data
- [x] Phase 4Q: health endpoint production-minimal response + IP throttling

## Remaining Future Work (Phase 4+)

| Item | Target |
|------|--------|
| Advisor Dashboard | Phase 4 — multi-client, `advisor_user_id` scoping |
| `advisor_notes` API | Advisor OS annotations |
| RLS-respecting reads | Reduce service-role read surface |
| Rate limiting | Phase 4Q — in-memory MVP limiter on write routes |
| Protect health endpoints | Phase 4Q — production-minimal response + IP rate limit |
| Email confirmation / MFA | Auth hardening |
| localStorage deprecation | Full cloud-only client state |
| Real-time subscriptions | Optional live dashboard updates |
| PDF export from stored snapshots | Reporting enhancement |

## Build Verification

Run before deploying or starting Phase 4:

```bash
npm run build
npx tsc --noEmit
```

---

## Phase 3 Status

**COMPLETE** — All client-portal Supabase persistence, auth, audit, and security review items are done. Safe to begin Advisor Dashboard.
