## 6. Work queue action href allowlist

Phase 10.2: `/advisor/**` only.

Phase 11 extension:

## 8. Error and fallback routes

| Route | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `/advisor-v2/*` (flag off) | `AdvisorV2Disabled` — safe message, no data leak |
| `/advisor-v2/*` (non-pilot adviser) | Same as flag off |
| `/advisor-v2/*` (client user) | Access denied |
| `/advisor-v2/error` | Route-level error boundary Phase 01 |

---

## 9. Request ID convention

All V2 API responses include `X-Request-Id` (UUID v4) — generated server-side, logged without PII. Phase 01 establishes pattern.
